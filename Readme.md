# Convex Hull using Divide and Conquer 

<br>

The convex hull of a set of points is defined as the smallest convex polygon, that encloses all of the points in the set. Convex means that the polygon has no corner that is bent inwards[1](https://medium.com/@pascal.sommer.ch/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-convex-hull-problem-62dfcabee90c). This program implements the divide and conquer algorithm to compute the convex hull of a set of points.
